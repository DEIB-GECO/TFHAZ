Here we provide a BED file containing the HOT regions of transcription factor (TF) accumulation resulting from our global analysis of the most recent ENCODE Narrow peak data extracted from our [*GMQL*](http://www.gmql.eu/) public repository.
For our investigation, we collected only ENCODE samples containing ”optimal IDR thresholded peaks”, i.e., NARROW PEAK samples of higher quality according to the Irreproducible Discovery Rate
(IDR), which measures the reproducibility of high-throughput experiments. Thus, we considered to an overall amount of 12'601'854 input binding regions related to 486 different TFs.
Data extraction and processing were performed first using [**RGMQL**](https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/RGMQL), another R/Bioconductor package, and then our **TFHAZ** R/Bioconductor functions.
Please refer to the [*vignette*](https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/TFHAZ/tree/master/vignettes) for further details about using *TFHAZ* functionalities.
